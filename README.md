### Different features and functionalities of my website:

1. In this project, users can choose from a variety of available rooms on the
   home page. After clicking on a room, the user is redirected to the room
   details page. There, they can view detailed information about the room and,
   if logged into our website, book the room.

2. On the room page, users can view all the available rooms. By clicking the
   "Details" button, users can access the room details page, where they can also
   read reviews from previous guests who have booked the room.

3. On the room details page, clicking the "Book Now" button allows users to book
   the room if they are logged in. Otherwise, they are redirected to the login
   page. After logging in, users can proceed to the booking page and, upon
   completing the booking, view their booking details in the "My Booking" page.

4. In the "My Booking" page, users can view their booking details and booking
   dates. They can delete their booking up to 1 day before the booked date;
   otherwise, they will receive an alert. Users can also update the booking
   date, and a success message will be displayed using a sweet alert.

5. In the "My Booking" page, by clicking the "Share Reviews" button, users are
   redirected to a review input page where they can submit a review for the
   room. After completing the review submission, a confirmation alert is shown,
   and the review is updated on the individual room's details page. In this
   project, I use React Helmet, toast, and animations.
